# AGV-Task-1-ETH-Zurich

- All the directories above are the unedited workspaces which I used. 
- I created different workspaces for every task so that I can deal with them easily.
- Directly downloading and doing catkin build to rebuild them might not always work coz paths and referrences exist or smth.
- But the packages are there so maybe making a new workspace with those packages should clean everything up and make it work.
